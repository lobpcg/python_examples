Various python examples

https://github.com/lobpcg/python_examples/blob/master/networkx_example.py is my exercise for a coding test at a job interview, which I have then pushed into https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5165 and that has become https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/main/examples/algorithms/plot_subgraphs.py . I dedicate this work to our cat who passed away after a long happy life with us, coincidently on the same day as the PR merge.
