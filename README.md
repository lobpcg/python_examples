Various python examples

https://github.com/lobpcg/python_examples/blob/master/benchmark_spectral_labeling.py is a benchmark that I wrote for https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21148 mimicking the code written for https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8091045 that has won MIT/AWS Graph Challenge 2017 Student Innovation Awards; see https://graphchallenge.mit.edu/champions . The benchmark code comes with a couple of files with matrices for the benchmoark copied from https://graphchallenge.mit.edu/data-sets

https://github.com/lobpcg/python_examples/blob/master/networkx_example.py is my exercise for a coding test at a job interview, which I have then pushed into https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5165 and that has become https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/main/examples/algorithms/plot_subgraphs.py . I dedicate this work to our cat who passed away after a long happy life with us, coincidently on the same day as the PR merge.
